Sweet little Ching she's looking for me
Sweet little Ching she's looking for me (ah ahn)

(Ooh) Seventy seven
(Ooh) She gave me heaven

Secret police is looking for me
A latin lover from Italy

(Ooh) Seventy seven
(Ooh) She gave me heaven

(Ooh) Seventy seven
(Ooh) She gave me heaven

Sweet little Ching she's looking for me
A latin lover from Italy

(Ooh) Seventy seven
(Ooh) She gave me heaven

Then sound came to the silent kind
Better for you, my Chinese guide

When I met Ching
In a Canton square
She was playing with some friends
The electric guitar
I said electric guitar

Ching sang a song
That broke my soul
Chinese kind
Of rock n' roll

She played something beautiful
But she played something sweet
It was impossible for me
Not to move my feet
So I said to little Ching
Touch my skin
Calm calm baby
You know what you mean

You'd never suppose that that electric Fender
Was a crime against their nation now
Little Ching she laid some jazz
From a long, a long, a long game
1, 2, 3, 4 little Ching
She played something beautiful
She played something sweet
It was impossible for me
Not to move my feet
Yeah!
Impossible for me not to move my feet
Ching sang a song that broke my soul
The Chinese kind
Of rock n' roll
1, 2, 3, 4 sweet little Ching
Moan and move
Sweet little Ching

Then sound came to the silent kind
Better for you, to my Chinese guide

(Ooh) Seventy seven
(Ooh) She gave me heaven

(Ooh) Seventy seven
(Ooh) She gave me heaven

(Ooh) Seventy seven
(Ooh) She gave me heaven

(Ooh) Seventy seven
(Ooh) She gave me heaven

(Ooh) Seventy seven
(Ooh) She gave me heaven

(Ooh) Seventy seven
(Ooh) She gave me heaven

(Ooh) Seventy seven
