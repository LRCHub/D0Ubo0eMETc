Sweet little Ching
She's looking for me

A latin lover
From Italy

Deng Xiaoping
Didn't say ok
Better for you
To like a Chinese guy

When I met Ching
In a Canton square
She was playing with some friends
The electric guitar
I said electric guitar

Ching sang a song
That broke my soul
Chinese kind
Of rock n' roll
She played something evil
Then she played something sweet
It was impossible for me
Not to move my feet
So I said to little Ching
Touch my skin
Calm calm baby
You know what you mean
You'd never suppose that my lady friend
Was a crime against their nation now
Little Ching she laid some jazz
So I'm alone, alone, alone again
1, 2, 3, 4 little Ching
She played something evil
Then she played something sweet
It was impossible for me
Not to move my feet
Yeah!
Impossible for me
Not to move my feet
Ching sang a song
That broke my soul
The Chinese kind
Of rock n' roll
1, 2, 3, 4 sweet little Ching
Moan and move
Sweet little Ching
